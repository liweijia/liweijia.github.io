I am an incoming Tenure-Track Associate Professor at Institute of Data and Information, [SIGS, Tsinghua University](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), starting from 2026 Spring. Previously, I was an Associate Professor (2021.11-2026.1) at Sun Yat-sen University. I was a Post-doc Researcher (2019.11-2021.11) at [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/index_cn.html), Department of Information Engineering, CUHK, working with [Prof. Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). I received my Ph.D. (2014-2019) from Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua Univeristy, advised by [Prof. Haohuan Fu](https://www.thuhpgc.net/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu), and the Bachelor degree (2010-2014) from Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen Univeristy.

My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and their applications in urban remote sensing, with a recent focus on large multimodal models, generative models and AI agents. I serve as a reviewer for many SCI journals and TOP conferences, including RSE, ISPRS P&RS, IEEE TIP/TGRS/TCSVT, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, etc.

I am looking for self-motivated PostDoc, graduate/undergraduate students and research interns. We have close research collaboration with [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested!
