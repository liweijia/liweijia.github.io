I am currently an Associate Professor at [School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-Sen University](http://sges.sysu.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a Post-doc Researcher (2019-2021) at CUHK-Sensetime Joint Lab ([MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/index_cn.html)), Department of Information Engineering, CUHK, working with [Prof. Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). I received my Ph.D. (2014-2019) from Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua Univeristy, advised by [Prof. Haohuan Fu](http://47.94.243.94/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu), and the Bachelor degree (2010-2014) from Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen Univeristy.

My research interests include remote sensing image understanding, computer vision, and deep learning. I serve as a reviewer for many SCI journals and TOP conferences, including RSE, ISPRS P&RS, IEEE TIP, IEEE TGRS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, etc.

I am looking for self-motivated graduate/undergraduate students and research interns. We have close research collaboration with [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested!
