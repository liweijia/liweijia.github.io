  title={Joint Semantic-Geometric Learning for Polygonal Building Segmentation},
  author={Weijia Li and Wenqian Zhao and Huaping Zhong and Conghui He and Dahua Lin},
  abstract={Building extraction from aerial or satellite images has been an important research issue in remote sensing and computer vision domains for decades. Compared with pixel-wise semantic segmentation models that output raster building segmentation map, polygonal building segmentation approaches produce more realistic building polygons that are in the desirable vector format for practical applications. Despite the substantial efforts over recent years, state-of-the-art polygonal building segmentation methods still suffer from several limitations, e.g., (1) relying on a perfect segmentation map to guarantee the vectorization quality; (2) requiring a complex post-processing procedure; (3) generating inaccurate vertices with a fixed quantity, a wrong sequential order, inter-sections, etc. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a polygonal building segmentation approach and make the following contributions: (1) We design a multi-task segmentation network for joint semantic and geometric learning via three tasks, i.e., pixel-wise building segmentation, multi-class corner prediction, and edge orientation prediction. (2) We propose a simple but effective vertex generation module for transforming the segmentation contour into high-quality polygon vertices. (3) We further propose a polygon refinement network that automatically moves the polygon vertices into more accurate locations. Results on two popular building segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements for both building instance segmentation (with 2\% F1-score gain) and polygon vertex prediction (with 8\% F1-score gain) compared with current state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
